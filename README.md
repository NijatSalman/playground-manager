# Playground Manager Application

This Spring Boot application manages a playground system where children can visit play sites with limited capacity. It supports registering visitors, handling queues when sites are full, auto-promoting kids from queues, and tracking visitor details in-memory. The system offers APIs for managing play sites, removing visitors, and grouping or counting current attendees.

### Business Logic and Functional Highlights
- **Play Site Management:** Create, update, retrieve, and delete play sites, each with custom attraction types and capacities.
- **Visitor Registration:** Add kids to a play site if space is available, or place them in a waiting queue if full.
- **Queue Handling:** Automatically promote kids from the waiting queue when a spot opens in the play site.
- **Visitor Removal:** Remove a visitor by their ticket number, cleanly updating play site state and promoting queued visitors.
- **Visitor Tracking:** Track each visitorâ€™s name, age, ticket number, play site, and whether they are in the queue.
- **In-Memory Storage:** All play site and visitor data are managed in-memory using thread-safe structures.
- **Grouped View:** View all visitors grouped by play site name.
- **Total Count:** Retrieve the current total number of active visitors in the system.
